Constraint-based programming is a modular approach to describe a complex task. We proposed to simultaneously minimize the error dynamics of each constraint by solving a quadratic optimization problem, see the details in the [slides](http://gamma.cs.unc.edu/MPIR/icra_workshop.pdf) and the [research paper](https://ywang-robotics.github.io/publication/2014-08-15-paper-ifac-number-9) using a pan cleaning example.
