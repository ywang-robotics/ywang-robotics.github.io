In the future mobile dual-arm robots are expected to perform many tasks. Kinematically, the configuration of two manipulators that branch from the same common mobile base results in a serial-to-parallel kinematic structure, which makes inverse kinematic computations non-trivial. The motion of the base has to be decided in a trade-off, taking the needs of both arms into account. We propose to use a Virtual Kinematic Chain (VKC) to specify the common motion of the parallel manipulators, instead of using the two manipulators kinematics directly. With this VKC, we formulate a constraint based programming solution for the robot to respond to external disturbances during task execution. The proposed approach is experimentally verified both in a noise-free illustrative simulation and a real human robot co-manipulation task.
