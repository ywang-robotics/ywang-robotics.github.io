We use the Bayesian Optimization procedure to regulate the RBFNs corresponding to different tasks based on performances indexes that are extracted for a fixed episode.
In comparison with tuning the weights using another stochastic optimizationtechnique, i.e., CMA-ES, we find that the proposed approachrequires much less samples to evaluate.
