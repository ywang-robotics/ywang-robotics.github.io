Using the gradient of the collision avoidance task as hard constraints of a quadratic programming (QP) controller, we assign strict priority to avoid collisions and specify other QP controller objectives with soft task priorities. Through experiments performed on a dual-arm robot, we show that the proposed solution is able to generate safe robot motion that fulfills the task specifications while keeping the feasibility of the underlying quadratic optimization problem.
