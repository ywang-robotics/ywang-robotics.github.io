excerpt: 'We summarize the impact-aware constraints formulation of the model-based quadratic-programming controller. The impact-awareness enables online *filtering* of the reference contact velocities such that all the constraints are respected despite the impact'

introduce the impact-awareness to the QP controller by including the gradient of impact-induced state jumps with respect to the QP decision variables.'

We propose the generic impact-aware constraints formulation for both the fixed-base robot and the floating-base robot.  We achieved much higher contact velocity than the state-of-the-art.
