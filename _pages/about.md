Since I was young, I feel interested in math and physics. By a happy chance, I gradually become a robotist from 2008. After years' adventure in the field, I feel that my mission is to develop robots that  faster and stronger. Bearing this in mind, my current research interests focus on **Impact-aware control**. 

Generating on-purpose impacts with rigid robots is challenging as they may lead to severe hardware failures due to  abrupt changes in the velocities and torques. Without dedicated hardware and controllers, robots typically operate at a near-zero velocity in the vicinity of contacts. Together with my team at LIRMM, we are making the initial steps towards a control solution to resolve this issue, see the [demo](https://youtu.be/-ciumPp6hzE) using the humanoid robot HRP-4, generating maximum contact velocities, neither breaking established contacts nor damaging the hardware.
