I published my C++ implementaion of frictional impact dynamics model [FIDynamics](https://gite.lirmm.fr/yuquan/fidynamics) presented in the paper [ Batting an In-Flight Object to the Target](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0278364918817116) by Professor [Jia Yan-bin](http://web.cs.iastate.edu/~jia/) and [Mu Xiaoqian](https://www.cs.iastate.edu/people/xiaoqian-mu-0). Using Figure 3.(b-f) of the paper, we made a few [test-examples](https://gite.lirmm.fr/yuquan/fidynamics/-/blob/master/unittest/ijrr_example/eclipsePentagonExample.cpp) to show the [FIDynamics API](http://yuquan.lirmm.net/fidynamics) usage.  


FIDynamics assumes Stronge's energetic coefficient of restitution and computes the impulse and post-impact states analytically. The average computation time is between 0.15-0.2ms which is fast enough to be used in real-time control. 


Performance-wise, compared to the state-of-the-art impact dynamics model, e.g., Section 11.7 of the book: Rigid body dynamics algorithms by Roy Featherstone, FIDynamics is able to predict the post-impact contact modes, computes the post-impact tangential impulse, and post-impact angular velocity.
