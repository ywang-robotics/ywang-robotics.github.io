As a continuition of my Master thesis project back in 2010, I realized optimization is a powerful tool for specifying control problems with inequalities. We documented the first result for a visual servoing problem in the [51st IEEE CDC in 2012](/publication/2012-12-10-paper-cdc-number-10), where we addressed the visibility constraint for [Position-based Visual servoing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_servoing) through the model predictive control approach.  

The optimization formulation provides a modular approach to specify objectives and constraints. Using a pan-cleaning task performed by the Schunk light weight arms, we demonstrated at [IFAC World congress 2014](/publication/2014-08-15-paper-ifac-number-9) the following: 

*  Quadratic programming (QP) provides a smoother trajectory compared to Linear programming (LP) thanks to its unique optimum.
*  Task-space specifications, e.g., admittance control, can be easiliy integrated into the QP, either as a part of the objective or as a constraint.
*  QP can simultaneously fulfill multiple objectives by scalarize a weighting sum.
