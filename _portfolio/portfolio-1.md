As a model-based approach, the quadratic-programming controllers need to preview the state jumps due to the impacts. 

We published the initial idea in  [RSS-2019](/publication/2019-06-22-paper-rss-number-3), where we proposed constraint formulation using  the predicted state jumps. Then we extend the result to floating-base robot in [Humanoids-2019](/publication/2019-10-15-paper-humanoids-number-2). Recently we summarized the generic impact-aware constraint formulation with through theoretical analysis and experiment results in the [IJRR-submission](/publication/2020-06-03-paper-ijrr-number-1)
